                <h1>Hi, I'm Lucas.</h1>
                <p>Since middle school, computer programing has been more of a hobby. Nothing was serious until after high school when it was time to choose a career and I thought nothing would be better than a hobby of mine. In college, I am currently learning C# and in my free time I am playing around with many other things such as Java, Java Script, and command line based git. I hope that one day  I can attain enough experience to turn one of my favorite hobbyâ€™s into a full time career.</p>
                
                <h1>Experience</h1>
                <p>I currently go to school as CWI and I have a full time job as a software engineer at Alert Sense. The combination of the two allows for me to build up a lot of experience very quickly using real world applications.</p>
