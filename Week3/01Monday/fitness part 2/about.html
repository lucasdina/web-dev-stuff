					<dt>Burpee</dt>

					<dt>Plank</dt>

					<dt>Mountain Climber</dt>
					<dd>Mountain limbers are a good cardio exercise. Place your hands on the floor in a pushup position, then bring one knee up to your chest and then switch as quickly as you can(as though you are climbimg a mountain).<br> </dd>
